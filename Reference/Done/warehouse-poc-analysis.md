## Architectural Questions for Implementation

### 1. Mobile Interface Strategy
**Questions:**
- Should we implement the mobile toggle as a responsive design feature or a dedicated mobile mode?
- How should we handle the transition between desktop and mobile interfaces?
- Should the mobile interface be a separate route or a mode toggle within existing pages?
- What's the optimal screen size threshold for auto-switching to mobile mode?

**Recommendations:**
- Implement as a mode toggle within the worker scanner page
- Use CSS classes to hide/show different UI elements based on mode
- Maintain separate input handlers for mobile vs desktop
- Store mobile preference in user preferences

### 2. Barcode Processing Architecture
**Questions:**
- How should we handle the barcode-to-customer priority queue in our database schema?
- Should duplicate barcode logic be handled in the frontend, backend, or both?
- How do we ensure real-time synchronization when multiple workers scan the same barcode?
- What's the optimal data structure for tracking "next customer" for each barcode?

**Recommendations:**
- Add `priority` and `remaining_qty` calculated fields to products table
- Implement queue logic in backend with WebSocket broadcasting
- Use database transactions for atomic barcode processing
- Cache frequently accessed barcode mappings

### 3. Session Management & Data Persistence
**Questions:**
- How should we structure session export/import with our current database schema?
- Should undo operations be stored as separate events or reverse operations?
- How do we handle concurrent session modifications by multiple users?
- What's the appropriate granularity for session state snapshots?

**Recommendations:**
- Extend current scan session schema to include detailed state snapshots
- Implement undo as compensating transactions with audit trail
- Use optimistic locking for session modifications
- Store session snapshots at regular intervals and before major operations

### 4. Real-time Synchronization
**Questions:**
- How should we broadcast box state changes to all connected clients?
- What's the optimal WebSocket message format for real-time updates?
- How do we handle connection drops during critical scanning operations?
- Should we implement conflict resolution for simultaneous scans?

**Recommendations:**
- Design granular WebSocket events for specific state changes
- Implement automatic reconnection with state resynchronization
- Use eventual consistency with conflict resolution strategies
- Buffer critical operations during connection issues

### 5. Performance & Scalability
**Questions:**
- How should we implement the efficiency scoring algorithm with our current metrics?
- What's the optimal caching strategy for frequently accessed data?
- How do we ensure the mobile interface remains responsive with large datasets?
- Should performance calculations be real-time or batch processed?

**Recommendations:**
- Implement scoring as computed properties with caching
- Use Redis or in-memory caching for hot data paths
- Implement progressive loading for large box grids
- Calculate performance metrics asynchronously

  private snapshots: SessionSnapshot[] = [];
  private currentIndex = 0;
  
  async undo(): Promise<SessionSnapshot> {
    // Implement undo logic with state restoration
  }
  
  async exportSession(): Promise<string> {
    // Export complete session state as JSON
  }
  
  async importSession(data: string): Promise<void> {
    // Import and restore session state
  }
}
```

### 4. Real-time Event System
```typescript
// WebSocket event types for enhanced features
type WebSocketEvent = 
  | { type: 'SCAN_PROCESSED', data: { boxNumber: number, animation: boolean } }
