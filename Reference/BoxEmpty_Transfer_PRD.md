# Box Empty/Transfer System - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the comprehensive Box Empty/Transfer system that provides instant automatic actions: Empty Box removes current customer and automatically assigns next unallocated customer, Transfer Box moves customer to their designated CSV group and automatically assigns next unallocated customer. When no unallocated customers exist, boxes display "Empty" status as grey boxes with full history access. The system eliminates all manual workflows and provides seamless automatic operations with no confirmation dialogs.

## Business Objectives

- **Efficient Box Reuse**: Automatically reallocate emptied boxes to maximize box utilization
- **Group Management**: Enable transfer of completed boxes to group views for organized processing
- **Quality Control**: Provide history tracking for all box contents and transfers
- **Worker Flexibility**: Support "Put Aside" functionality for items requiring special handling
- **Seamless Operations**: Background processing with minimal workflow disruption

## User Personas

### Primary Users
- **Managers**: Full control over box limits, group transfers, and system configuration
- **Supervisors**: Box emptying, transfer operations, and worker oversight
- **Workers**: Basic box emptying (with permission) and put aside item handling

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Box System**: Uses `boxRequirements` table with customer-to-box mapping
- **Group Support**: Already has `groupName` field in box requirements  
- **Worker Permissions**: Has `checkBoxEnabled` preference system for granular permissions
- **WebSocket**: Real-time updates for scanning operations
- **History Tracking**: Existing scan events and session management infrastructure

### Integration Points
- **Box Details Modal**: Add Empty/Transfer buttons for completed boxes
- **Manager Dashboard**: Add box limit configuration and monitoring
- **Worker Scanner**: Add put aside item notifications and handling
- **Group Views**: Display transferred boxes with full content history

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Box Empty Functionality

#### 1.1 Empty Button Availability
- **Trigger**: Appears when box is 100% complete AND customer has no groupName from CSV
- **Permissions**: Controlled by `canEmptyAndTransfer` user preference
- **Context**: Available in Box Details Modal for completed boxes
- **Behavior**: Instant automatic empty operation with no confirmation dialogs
- **Exclusivity**: Never shown simultaneously with Transfer button

#### 1.2 Automatic Box Reallocation
- **Trigger**: When box is emptied and job has `boxNumber: NULL` customers (unallocated due to box limit)
- **Process**: Automatically assign next unallocated customer to that specific box number
- **Selection**: First unallocated customer (FIFO order from original CSV sequence)
- **Database Update**: Change `boxNumber` from `NULL` to the emptied box number for all products of that customer
- **Transition**: If unallocated customers exist: seamless assignment to new customer. If no unallocated customers: box shows "Empty" status
- **Notification**: Detailed notification format: "Box 5: Customer A emptied | Customer C assigned" or "Box 5: Customer A emptied | No customers available - Box Empty"
- **Worker Impact**: Workers skip NULL boxes and recalculate their sequence dynamically
- **Box Number Retention**: Emptied/transferred boxes retain their box number for history tracking

#### 1.3 Box History System
- **Scope**: Show all previous contents for the specific box number across the job
- **Access**: Available in Box Details Modal below main content
- **Detail Level**: Transfer summaries with timestamps and worker information
- **Clickable Details**: Expandable to show specific scan-by-scan history

### 2. Transfer to Group Functionality

#### 2.1 Transfer Button Logic
- **Availability**: When customer has groupName from CSV AND box is 100% complete
- **Action**: Instant automatic transfer to customer's existing CSV group (no manual selection)
- **API Logic**: Auto-detect customer's groupName from database, no targetGroup parameter required
- **Exclusivity**: Never shown simultaneously with Empty button
- **No Manual Selection**: Group assignment is automatic based on existing CSV data

#### 2.2 Group View Integration
- **Display**: Show transferred boxes with original box numbers preserved
- **Permanence**: Transferred boxes remain permanently in group view
- **Updates**: Static after transfer (no real-time scanning updates)
- **History**: Maintain complete transfer chain for audit purposes
- **Organization**: Group boxes by transfer date and original assignment
- **Archival**: All group/transfer data archived with job, purged when job is purged

### 3. Put Aside System (FULLY CLARIFIED)

#### 3.1 Critical Precondition: Box Limit Required
- **MANDATORY CHECK**: Put Aside logic ONLY runs when job has a box limit set
- **No Limit = No Put Aside**: If job has no box limit, all items go to regular boxes or Extra Items
- **Implementation**: First check `job.boxLimit !== null` before any Put Aside logic

#### 3.2 Put Aside Logic Flow (FINALIZED)
- **Trigger**: Scanned item cannot be allocated to any existing box
- **System Decision Process**:
  1. Check if job has box limit → If NO limit: skip Put Aside logic entirely
  2. Item scanned → Cannot allocate to existing boxes
  3. Check every unallocated customer's product list for this barcode
  4. IF barcode matches unallocated customer requirements → "Put Aside"
  5. IF barcode matches NO requirements (boxes OR unallocated customers) → "Extra Items"
- **Worker Experience**: Worker scans normally, system makes all decisions automatically
- **Storage**: Store as scan events with special "put_aside" type

#### 3.3 Put Aside UI Integration
- **Location**: Separate "Put Aside" button in Overall Progress panel (next to "Extra Items")
- **NOT Customer Queue**: Completely separate from Customer Queue button
- **Display Format**: "Put Aside: X" showing count of items awaiting allocation
- **Button Styling**: Same styling as "Extra Items" button but with orange color and different icon
- **Modal Content**: List showing barcode, product name, and total qty (combine duplicate barcodes)
- **Modal Exclusions**: No unallocated customers, no timestamps, focus on item summary only

#### 3.4 Put Aside Item Allocation (SCAN-TRIGGERED PRIORITY)
- **Allocation Trigger**: When Put Aside item is SCANNED and matching box is available
- **NOT Automatic**: Put Aside items do NOT automatically allocate when boxes become available
- **Allocation Logic**: Scan Put Aside barcode → find first available box following worker patterns → allocate
- **Box Assignment**: First available box that accepts barcode, following worker allocation patterns (ascending/descending)
- **Database Process**: Create new regular scan event AND mark Put Aside event as allocated
- **WebSocket Updates**: Trigger same real-time updates as regular scans
- **Lifecycle**: Items remain in Put Aside list until manually scanned and allocated (no expiration)

### 4. Manager Configuration

#### 4.1 Box Limit Setting (FOUNDATION FEATURE)
- **Location**: Optional field in job creation/CSV upload form ("Max Boxes: [50]" or "No Limit")
- **Default**: "No Limit" - system creates boxes for all customers as before
- **Function**: Hard limit that stops creation of new boxes for customers beyond the limit
- **Processing Flow**: Build full customerToBoxMap, then modify boxRequirements creation to set `boxNumber: null` for excess customers
- **Warning Threshold**: Show warning if limit is less than 80% of total unique customers (e.g., 40 boxes for 50 customers)
- **Warning Timing**: After CSV is uploaded and we know total unique customers
- **Storage**: `box_limit INTEGER DEFAULT NULL` in jobs table
- **Unallocated Storage**: Customers beyond limit stored as `boxNumber: NULL` in `box_requirements`

#### 4.2 Manager Dashboard Integration
- **Location**: When manager clicks on a job with unallocated customers, show in job management area
- **Unallocated Customers Section**: New section showing customers with `boxNumber: NULL`
- **Customer Details**: Display each unallocated customer with their required products
- **Product Preview**: Similar to Box Details screen, showing BarCode, Product Name, Qty
- **Auto-Assignment Status**: Show when customers get automatically assigned to emptied boxes
- **Put Aside Count**: Show total count of items with available boxes (green tick)
- **Transfer Tracking**: Monitor group transfers and box reallocation
- **Worker Performance**: Track empty/transfer operations per worker
- **System Health**: Monitor automatic reallocation success rates

### 5. Concurrency Control

#### 5.1 Optimistic Locking Strategy
- **Method**: First-wins approach for concurrent operations
- **Scope**: Box emptying, transferring, and put aside allocation operations
- **Implementation**: Version-based conflict detection and resolution
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages when operations conflict

### 6. Worker Interface Enhancements

#### 6.1 Permission System
- **Granularity**: Combined "Empty/Transfer" permission (single toggle)
- **Scope**: No restrictions based on worker involvement in box
- **Job Status**: Available for any active or completed job
- **Role-based**: Managers and Supervisors have automatic access

#### 6.2 Worker Allocation Pattern Adaptation
- **Dynamic Recalculation**: Workers skip NULL boxes and recalculate their sequence dynamically
- **Real-time Updates**: When boxes get assigned from NULL to real customers, worker patterns adapt
- **Box Availability**: Workers see newly available boxes immediately in their allocation sequence

#### 6.3 Put Aside Notifications
- **Display**: Count of items with available boxes on worker screen
- **Interaction**: Click for details modal showing available items
- **Action**: Standard scanning process - direct worker to appropriate box
- **Updates**: Real-time updates as boxes become available

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Changes

#### New Tables
```sql
-- Box History Tracking
CREATE TABLE box_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  job_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES jobs(id),
  box_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  action_type ENUM('empty', 'transfer', 'reallocate') NOT NULL,
  performed_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  transferred_to_group VARCHAR(255), -- NULL for empty/reallocate
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Put Aside Items
CREATE TABLE put_aside_items (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  job_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES jobs(id),
  bar_code VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  product_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  custom_name VARCHAR(255), -- "Put Aside - <CustomName>"
  box_available BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  allocated_at TIMESTAMP, -- When item was allocated to a box
  allocated_to_box INTEGER -- Box number when allocated
);
```

#### Table Modifications
```sql
-- Add box limit to jobs
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN box_limit INTEGER DEFAULT NULL;

-- Add box status tracking (CRITICAL: separate from isComplete)
ALTER TABLE box_requirements ADD COLUMN box_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active';
-- Values: 'active', 'emptied', 'transferred_to_group'

-- Add empty/transfer permission (already exists as canEmptyAndTransfer)
-- ALTER TABLE user_preferences ADD COLUMN can_empty_and_transfer BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Enhanced scan events for Put Aside (NO separate table needed)
-- Put Aside items stored as scan events with eventType='put_aside'
-- Put Aside items use: customerName=NULL, boxNumber=NULL initially
-- Additional columns to support Put Aside functionality:
ALTER TABLE scan_events ADD COLUMN allocated_to_box INTEGER DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE scan_events ADD COLUMN allocated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL;

-- Add version column for optimistic locking
ALTER TABLE box_requirements ADD COLUMN version INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
```

```

## User Experience Flows

### Manager Workflow
1. **Job Setup**: Upload CSV → Set Box Limit → Enable automatic reallocation
2. **Monitoring**: View put aside count → Monitor transfers → Review box history
3. **Group Management**: Review transferred boxes → Quality control checks

### Worker/Supervisor Workflow  
1. **Box Completion**: Scan final item → Box shows 100% complete
2. **Box Actions**: Click Box Details → See Empty OR Transfer button (never both)
3. **Empty Action**: Click Empty → Instant automatic reallocation → Detailed notification
4. **Transfer Action**: Click Transfer → Instant automatic transfer to CSV group → Detailed notification
5. **Empty Box Display**: Grey box with black circle, white number, "Empty" text, clickable for history

### Put Aside Item Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Item needs box → No suitable box → "Put Aside" scan
2. **Waiting**: Item in queue → Red cross indicator → Waiting for box
3. **Available**: Box becomes free → Green tick indicator → Worker notification
4. **Allocation**: Worker scans item → Auto-allocate to box → Remove from queue
