# BETA TEST Job Calculation Analysis

## Job Overview
- **Job Name:** BETA TEST
- **Job ID:** 31985862-0d42-41cf-be24-952f478fe70a
- **Status:** Pending
- **Created:** 19/08/2025

## System Calculation Results
- **Total Products:** 162 (from CSV rows)
- **Total Customers:** 75 (unique customers)
- **Total Boxes:** 75 (one box per customer)
- **Total Items to Scan:** 255 (sum of all quantities)

## Verification Analysis

### 1. Database Verification
✅ **Products Table Analysis:**
- Total product rows: 162
- Unique customers: 75
- Box numbers range: 1 to 75
- Each customer assigned to exactly one box (no customer spans multiple boxes)

### 2. Box Assignment Logic Verification
The system uses the POC-compliant logic from `server/routes.ts` lines 338-348:

```javascript
// POC-Compliant Box Assignment: Customers assigned to boxes 1-100 by first appearance order
const customerToBoxMap = new Map<string, number>();
let nextBoxNumber = 1;

// Build customer-to-box mapping based on first appearance in CSV
csvData.forEach(row => {
  if (!customerToBoxMap.has(row.CustomName)) {
    customerToBoxMap.set(row.CustomName, nextBoxNumber);
    nextBoxNumber++;
  }
});
```

This logic:
- ✅ Iterates through CSV rows in order
- ✅ Assigns each unique customer to the next available box number (1, 2, 3, ...)
- ✅ Ensures one customer = one box relationship
- ✅ Results in 75 unique customers = 75 boxes

### 3. Calculation Formula
```
Total Products = Number of CSV rows = 162
Total Customers = COUNT(DISTINCT CustomName) = 75
Total Boxes = Total Customers = 75
Total Quantity = SUM(Qty field) = 255
```

### 4. Sample Customer Distribution
First 20 customers and their box assignments:
- 1152689 → Box 1 (1 product, 1 quantity)
- 1153606 → Box 2 (1 product, 2 quantity)
- 1153708 → Box 3 (2 products, 12 quantity)
- 1154024 → Box 4 (2 products, 7 quantity)
- And so on...

## Conclusion
✅ **The calculation is CORRECT**

The "BETA TEST" job correctly shows:
- **162 products** - This represents the number of CSV rows/product lines
- **75 boxes** - This represents the number of unique customers, with each customer getting their own box

The system follows the proper business logic where:
1. Each customer gets assigned to exactly one box
2. Box numbers are assigned sequentially (1-75) based on first appearance in CSV
3. Multiple products for the same customer go into the same box
4. The total of 162 products distributed across 75 customer boxes is accurate

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Uses Map data structure for efficient customer-to-box lookup
- Maintains referential integrity (no customer spans multiple boxes)
- Follows POC-compliant sequential box numbering
- Properly handles multiple products per customer in the same box
