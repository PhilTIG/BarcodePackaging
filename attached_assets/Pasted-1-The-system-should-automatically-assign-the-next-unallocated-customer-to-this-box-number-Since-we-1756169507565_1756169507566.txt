1. The system should automatically assign the next unallocated customer to this box number. Since we will automatically reassign the box will skip the empty status and just show the new customName that is allocated to it. (So no need to handle a transition).
2. Yes it should create a "Aside" scan event type. A list of all the items put aside can be presented in the same way and next to the Extra Items icon and similar screen list (Queue/View when clicked on. An additional "Box Available" info should show. This will show a Red cross or a Green Tick indicating if there is now a box available for the put aside item. If the item code is scanned in then it will allocated to that box (Outside the system the manager can instruct a worker to do this). We can have a "Check Put Aside" message show to the worker on their screen and show the product items name when clicked on. The icon should have a green tick on it. This should show also on the their single box view. Please ask more question about the answers to question 2 if not enough information is given?
3. Yes we should maintain the original box number. The new customName is what each box contents should be referenced. Yes we will track multiple transfers of the same box number. Each transfer will be for a different CustomName. The Group View should show realtime updates
4. The setting will be just one permission that handles both scenarios. Worker can empty or transfer any completed (100%) box (not limited to boxes they have worked on). No Job Status limit unless entire job is paused.
5. History should show all boxes that used this box number across the job. Should show very similar details to the Box details screen view. This should even have a check button so someone can scan that previous box contents to confirm the stock is correct. Please as follow up questions if needed to understand more.
6. This should it be a job-level setting during CSV upload (only have this per job)


**Extra info
* The Manager / Supervisor monitor screen should have a "Group Allocation" button that shows the percentage of the total CustomName allocation to Groups. The calculation is the percentage of the number of CustomName Boxes allocated vs Total CustomNames in the CSV.
* Make special note to be very careful with the existing structure of the system and notify if changing any core functionality that already exists.
