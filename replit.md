# Warehouse Sorting Barcode Scanner App

## Overview

This is a comprehensive warehouse sorting application designed to streamline the sorting process of purchased goods with different customer destinations. The app provides role-based interfaces for managers, supervisors, and warehouse workers to upload CSV data, track job progress, and perform barcode scanning operations. The system emphasizes real-time collaboration, performance tracking, and efficient sorting workflows with visual feedback and progress monitoring.

**Enhanced Active Jobs UI (January 14, 2025):**
- **Box Counting**: Changed "customers" to "boxes" terminology throughout the interface, reflecting that each customer destination represents one box
- **Progress Visualization**: Enhanced progress bars with clear percentage display and improved visual hierarchy
- **Boxes Complete Counter**: Added bottom-right positioned counter showing "X/Y boxes complete" in a dedicated widget
- **Worker Name Display**: Cleaned up worker assignment display by removing staff IDs from the Active Jobs section
- **Completion Highlighting**: Implemented light green background for 100% completed jobs
- **Layout Improvements**: Added proper spacing to prevent overlap with the new boxes counter widget

**Responsive Box Grid System (January 14, 2025):**
- **User Preferences**: Added "Maximum Boxes Per Row" setting in main Settings page (range 4-16)
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile shows 2 columns, scales up based on screen size and user preference
- **Badge Enhancement**: Doubled badge size (12x12) and repositioned to center-right of each box
- **Automatic Reflow**: Flexbox implementation automatically adjusts columns based on screen size and setting

## User Preferences

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The client is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React with TypeScript. The architecture follows a component-based approach with:

- **React Router**: Uses Wouter for lightweight client-side routing with role-based page access
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) handles server state, caching, and data synchronization
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod schema validation for type-safe form management
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live progress tracking and collaborative features

The app supports multiple color themes (blue, green, orange, teal, red, dark) with CSS custom properties for consistent theming across components.

### Backend Architecture

The server follows a RESTful API design using Express.js with TypeScript:

- **API Layer**: Express routes handle HTTP requests with middleware for logging, authentication, and error handling
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication for collaborative features and live updates
- **File Processing**: Multer for CSV file uploads with streaming CSV parsing
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with bcrypt for password hashing
- **Database Abstraction**: Custom storage interface provides a clean separation between business logic and data persistence

### Data Storage Solutions

The application uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with Drizzle ORM:

- **ORM**: Drizzle provides type-safe database queries and schema management
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL for scalable cloud hosting
- **Schema Design**: Relational design with tables for users, jobs, products, scan sessions, scan events, and job assignments
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit handles database schema migrations and version control

Key entities include role-based users (manager/supervisor/worker), CSV-based jobs with product inventories, customer box assignments, and detailed scan session tracking for performance analytics.

### Authentication and Authorization

The system implements role-based access control:

- **Authentication**: Staff ID and PIN-based login system suitable for warehouse environments
- **Session Management**: Server-side session storage with PostgreSQL session store
- **Role-based Routing**: Client-side route protection based on user roles (manager, supervisor, worker)
- **API Security**: Middleware validates user sessions and role permissions for protected endpoints

### Performance and Real-time Features

The application includes sophisticated performance tracking:

- **Scoring Algorithm**: Industry-standard performance metrics based on scans per hour (71 items/hour target)
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live performance dashboards with WebSocket updates
- **Session Management**: Persistent scan sessions with pause/resume functionality
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time job completion monitoring with visual progress indicators
